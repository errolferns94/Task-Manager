# Task Manager App

This project is a simple Task Manager Application built with React. As i had done a similar app named notes app, i have done the neccesary changes to the previous code and made it suit the requirements of a task manager.

Features
Add, edit, and delete tasks.
Mark tasks as completed.
Assign priority to tasks (low, medium, high).

The main application code is in the src directory:

App.js: Main component rendering the NotesApp.
NotesApp.js: Component managing the task notes.
